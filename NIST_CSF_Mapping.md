# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Mapping â€“ Wireshark Network Analysis Lab

This file maps lab exercises to the five core NIST CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

| NIST CSF Function | Category | Lab Activity | Description |
|------------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Detect | Anomalies and Events (DE.AE) | Analyze DNS tunneling, suspicious HTTP traffic | Detecting unusual activity via PCAP |
| Detect | Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM) | Real-time packet capture | Demonstrates visibility into network operations |
| Respond | Analysis (RS.AN) | Investigating captured traffic | Understanding indicators and evidence from PCAPs |
| Identify | Asset Management (ID.AM) | Mapping traffic to internal hosts | Identifying IPs, hostnames, MAC addresses |
| Protect | Awareness and Training (PR.AT) | Hands-on Wireshark use | Builds analyst skills in protocol and attack recognition |

ðŸŽ¯ **Value**: Your lab shows how continuous monitoring and packet analysis aligns with NIST best practices.
