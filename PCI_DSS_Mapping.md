# PCI DSS Mapping – Wireshark Network Analysis Lab

This file maps the Wireshark lab to relevant PCI DSS requirements, focusing on network monitoring and traffic analysis.

| PCI DSS Requirement | Description | Lab Relevance |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Req 10 – Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data | Log and monitor all activity | Wireshark is used to inspect access and anomalies in network traffic |
| Req 11.4 – Use IDS/IPS to monitor traffic at the perimeter and critical points | Detect intrusions or unusual behavior | Wireshark demonstrates packet-level visibility for threat detection |
| Req 12.10 – Implement an incident response plan | Be prepared for breaches | Traffic analysis supports investigation during incidents |

🔐 **Note**: While Wireshark itself isn’t a PCI-approved tool, it supports visibility necessary for compliance.
