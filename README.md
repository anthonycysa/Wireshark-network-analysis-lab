# 🧪 Wireshark Network Analysis Lab

This lab uses Wireshark to analyze real-world network traffic, identify suspicious activity, and build skills for threat detection, packet analysis, and incident investigation.

## 📊 Features

- Capture and analyze TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, FTP, and SMB traffic
- Identify suspicious or malicious patterns (e.g. C2, exfiltration, tunneling)
- Learn hands-on how attackers use the network and how defenders can respond
- Practice with .pcap files and filters to detect key behaviors
